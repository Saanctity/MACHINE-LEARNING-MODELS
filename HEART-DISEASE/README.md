# Heart Disease Detection System ðŸ«€

A machine learning system that predicts heart disease in patients using vital signs and medical data.

## Overview

This project analyzes patient data to predict the likelihood of heart disease using multiple ML algorithms including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and SVM.

## Dataset

The dataset contains patient vitals with the following features:

- **age**: Age in years
- **sex**: 0=female, 1=male
- **chestpaintype**: Type of chest pain (1-4)
- **restingbps**: Resting blood pressure (mmHg)
- **cholesterol**: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
- **fastingbloodsugar**: 1 if >120mg/dL, 0 otherwise
- **restingecg**: Resting ECG results (0-2)
- **maxheartrate**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **exerciseangina**: Exercise induced angina (0/1)
- **oldpeak**: ST depression
- **STslope**: Slope of peak exercise ST segment (1-3)
- **target**: 0=Normal, 1=Heart Disease

## Features

- **Automated EDA**: Comprehensive data analysis with visualizations
- **Multiple Models**: Tests 4 different ML algorithms
- **Best Model Selection**: Automatically picks the highest accuracy model
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, classification report
- **Feature Importance**: Shows which features matter most
- **Ready-to-Use Predictions**: Built-in function for new patient predictions

## Setup & Usage

### Google Colab (Recommended)

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Create a new notebook
3. Copy and paste the code
4. Run the cell
5. Upload your CSV dataset when prompted

### Local Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python heart_disease_detection.py
```

3. Upload your dataset when prompted

## Results

The model achieves:
- **High Accuracy**: Typically 85-92% on test data
- **Fast Training**: Complete analysis in under 5 minutes
- **Interpretable**: Clear feature importance and visualizations

## Model Performance

The system compares 4 models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine

Best model is automatically selected based on test accuracy.

## Output

The system provides:
- Data quality report
- Target distribution analysis
- Correlation heatmap
- Model performance comparison
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curves
- Feature importance rankings
- Example predictions

## Making Predictions

Use the built-in function for new patients:

```python
patient_data = {
    'age': 55,
    'sex': 1,
    'chestpaintype': 3,
    # ... other features
}

prediction, probability = predict_heart_disease(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {'Heart Disease' if prediction == 1 else 'Normal'}")
print(f"Probability: {probability:.2%}")
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
